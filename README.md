### Tresky's Solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI)

This repository contains my personal solutions to the coding interview questions that are
presented in the book Cracking the Coding Interview byGayle Laakmann McDowell.

This book is one of the best methods to prepare for technical interviews in the future. The
focus of this book is generally presented toward the top 5 technical companies of today, but
is a fantastic resource in a more general sense if you want to better yourself.
